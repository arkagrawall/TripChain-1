## 🚀 Project Overview

TRIPCHAIN is a scalable, multilingual platform designed to capture, analyze, and visualize trip-related data from travelers. Unlike traditional navigation apps, TRIPCHAIN offers seamless trip-chain detection, auto bump detection using phone sensors, and anonymized data sharing to enable smarter, safer, and data-driven transport planning across India.

Our solution bridges the gap between manual surveys and real-time mobility insights, benefiting travelers, researchers, government agencies, and tourism boards.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Trip Detection & Logging:** Automated trip segmentation and mode detection using GPS and sensor data
- **Auto Bump Detection:** Uses gyroscope data to identify road anomalies (potholes, speed breakers), with GPS tagging and adjustable sensitivity
- **Multilingual Support:** Integrated with Bhashini APIs for accessibility across India’s diverse languages
- **Safety Features:** SOS integration connecting users to hospitals and police in emergencies
- **Privacy-First:** Anonymized and encrypted data storage ensures user privacy
- **Government Dashboard:** Visualizations, aggregated insights, and heatmaps for planners and researchers
